# Machine Learning for Time Series

## Overview

This repository contains my coursework and projects for the **Machine Learning for Time Series** course in the MVA master's program at ENS Paris-Saclay. The course focuses on understanding, improving, modeling, and extracting information from time series data through various machine learning techniques.

## Course Objectives

- Understand the nature of time series and their significance in various fields.
- Explore data science principles tailored for time series analysis.
- Learn about different machine learning tasks applicable to time series, including prediction, classification, and anomaly detection.
- Focus on interpretable and reproducible ML algorithms without relying on deep learning.

## Course Outline

1. **Pattern Recognition and Detection**
2. **Feature Extraction and Selection**
3. **Models and Representation Learning**
4. **Data Enhancement and Preprocessing**
5. **Change-Point and Anomaly Detection**
6. **Multivariate Time Series**

## Main ML Tasks for Time Series

- **Prediction**: Forecast future values in a time series.
- **Completion/Interpolation**: Recover missing or lost samples.
- **Classification**: Assign labels to time series or subsequences.
- **Clustering**: Group time series with similar characteristics.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify abnormal events.
- **Pattern Extraction**: Find repetitive patterns in the data.
